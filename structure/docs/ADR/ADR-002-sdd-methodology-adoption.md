# ADR-002: SDD Methodology Adoption for Forge Development

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Deciders**: VSALMEID, forge-sdd-toolkit core team  
**Technical Story**: Establish development methodology for forge-sdd-toolkit

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Atlassian Forge app development currently faces several challenges:

1. **High Failure Rate**: ~40% of Forge projects fail to reach production
2. **Architecture Mistakes**: Wrong module choices discovered late (costly to fix)
3. **Incomplete Planning**: Missing requirements lead to scope creep
4. **Poor Traceability**: Hard to connect code back to original requirements
5. **Knowledge Silos**: Best practices scattered across docs, forums, examples

**Traditional Approach Problems**:
```
Developer: "I want to build a Jira app"
    ↓
Starts coding immediately
    ↓
Realizes wrong module after 2 weeks
    ↓
Rewrites from scratch
    ↓
Misses deadline, frustrated
```

**The Core Question**: How can we ensure Forge developers build the **right thing** (meets requirements) the **right way** (best architecture) **efficiently** (no rewrites)?

---

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Drivers

1. **Reduce Failure Rate**: Ensure projects succeed (production deployment)
2. **Architecture Quality**: Make correct decisions early (module, UI, storage)
3. **Complete Requirements**: Capture all needs before coding
4. **Full Traceability**: Every line of code traces to a requirement
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Embed Forge expertise in the process
6. **Automation-Friendly**: Enable GitHub Copilot orchestration

### Secondary Drivers

7. **Time Efficiency**: Faster overall despite more upfront planning
8. **Team Alignment**: Everyone understands the what and why
9. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify when requirements change
10. **Quality Gates**: Prevent moving forward with incomplete work

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Agile/Scrum (Traditional) - Rejected

**Approach**: Sprint-based development with user stories

**Typical Flow**:
```
Sprint 1: Build basic UI
Sprint 2: Add backend logic
Sprint 3: Integrate with Jira
Sprint 4: Fix architecture issues
Sprint 5: Refactor (wrong module chosen)
Sprint 6: Finally deploy
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Familiar to most teams
- ✅ Iterative feedback
- ✅ Flexible for changing requirements

**Cons**:
- ❌ **No architecture phase**: Module choice is code-level decision
- ❌ **Late discoveries**: Wrong choices discovered after implementation
- ❌ **Poor traceability**: Stories don't enforce requirement linkage
- ❌ **No specification document**: Requirements scattered in JIRA tickets
- ❌ **Doesn't leverage Copilot**: Can't automate orchestration

**Verdict**: ❌ Rejected - Doesn't solve Forge-specific architecture challenges

---

### Option 2: Waterfall (Traditional) - Rejected

**Approach**: Sequential phases with sign-offs

**Typical Flow**:
```
Phase 1: Requirements (2 weeks)
Phase 2: Design (2 weeks)
Phase 3: Implementation (4 weeks)
Phase 4: Testing (2 weeks)
Phase 5: Deployment (1 week)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Structured approach
- ✅ Documentation heavy
- ✅ Clear phase gates

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Too rigid**: Can't adapt to new insights
- ❌ **Long time to value**: First deployment after 11 weeks
- ❌ **Not Copilot-friendly**: Manual handoffs between phases
- ❌ **No Forge specifics**: Generic methodology doesn't capture platform constraints

**Verdict**: ❌ Rejected - Too slow and not adapted to Forge ecosystem

---

### Option 3: Code-First with Examples - Rejected

**Approach**: Start with working example, modify for needs

**Typical Flow**:
```
Developer: "I want GitHub integration"
    ↓
Finds example app
    ↓
Copies and modifies code
    ↓
Realizes example uses wrong module
    ↓
Tries to adapt (doesn't work)
    ↓
Starts over or gives up
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Fast initial progress
- ✅ Working code immediately
- ✅ Learning by example

**Cons**:
- ❌ **No planning**: Skips requirements and architecture
- ❌ **Example may not fit**: Different requirements need different approach
- ❌ **No traceability**: Can't explain why code exists
- ❌ **Hard to maintain**: Changes break because no specification

**Verdict**: ❌ Rejected - Fast but fragile

---

### Option 4: Specification-Driven Development (SDD) - ACCEPTED ✅

**Approach**: Specification is source of truth, drives all downstream artifacts

**Flow**:
```
IDEATE → Specification Document
    ↓ (all requirements captured)
ARCHITECT → Architecture Decision Document
    ↓ (all tech choices made with rationale)
PLAN → Implementation Plan + Backlog
    ↓ (all tasks defined with traceability)
IMPLEMENT → Working Code
    ↓ (code traces to tasks → stories → requirements)
TEST → Test Suite
    ↓ (tests validate acceptance criteria)
OPERATE → Deployed App
    ↓ (monitoring validates success metrics)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Requirements First**: Capture everything before architecture
- ✅ **Architecture Before Code**: Make decisions when cheap to change
- ✅ **Full Traceability**: Code → Task → Story → Requirement → User Need
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Can't proceed without completing previous stage
- ✅ **Copilot-Friendly**: Clear stages with defined inputs/outputs
- ✅ **Forge-Aware**: Embeds platform knowledge in architecture stage
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all decisions
- ✅ **Change Management**: Easy to modify (update spec, regenerate)

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ More upfront time (2-3 days before coding)
- ⚠️ Requires discipline (can't skip stages)
- ⚠️ Learning curve for teams new to SDD

**Verdict**: ✅ **ACCEPTED** - Pros align perfectly with Forge development needs

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Methodology**: **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**

### Core Principles

#### 1. Specification is the Source of Truth

**Traditional**:
```
Requirements → scattered in tickets, emails, Slack
Code → developer's interpretation
Tests → maybe cover some requirements
```

**SDD**:
```
Specification Document (formal, versioned)
    ├─ Functional Requirements (REQ-F-XXX)
    ├─ Non-Functional Requirements (REQ-NFR-XXX)
    ├─ User Stories (STORY-X.X)
    └─ Acceptance Criteria (AC-X.X.X)
         ↓
All downstream artifacts trace back
```

**Benefit**: Single source of truth, no ambiguity

---

#### 2. Six Mandatory Sequential Stages

**Cannot skip stages**. Each builds on previous.

```mermaid
graph LR
    I[IDEATE] --> A[ARCHITECT]
    A --> P[PLAN]
    P --> IM[IMPLEMENT]
    IM --> T[TEST]
    T --> O[OPERATE]
```

| Stage | Input | Output | Key Question |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **IDEATE** | User idea | Specification Document | What do we build? |
| **ARCHITECT** | Specification | Architecture Decision Document | How do we build it? |
| **PLAN** | Spec + ADD | Implementation Plan | Who does what when? |
| **IMPLEMENT** | Plan | Working Code | Code that implements tasks |
| **TEST** | Code + Spec | Test Suite | Does it meet acceptance criteria? |
| **OPERATE** | Tested App | Deployed App | Is it working in production? |

**Why Sequential?**:
- Can't architect without knowing requirements (IDEATE → ARCHITECT)
- Can't plan tasks without knowing tech stack (ARCHITECT → PLAN)
- Can't code without knowing what to build (PLAN → IMPLEMENT)
- Can't test without code (IMPLEMENT → TEST)
- Can't deploy without passing tests (TEST → OPERATE)

**Change Management**:
If requirements change, update Specification → regenerate downstream artifacts.

---

#### 3. Full Traceability

Every artifact connects to upstream requirements:

```
Code Line 47: const issueKey = context.platformContext.issueKey;
    ↓ traces to
TASK-1.2.1: Get issue key from context
    ↓ traces to
STORY-1.2: Display PR information in issue panel
    ↓ traces to
REQ-F-001: Show GitHub PR status in Jira issue
    ↓ traces to
User Need: Reduce context switching between GitHub and Jira
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
/**
 * Retrieves issue key from Forge context
 * 
 * Traces to:
 * - TASK-1.2.1: Get issue key from context
 * - STORY-1.2: Display PR information
 * - REQ-F-001: Show GitHub PR status
 */
const issueKey = context.platformContext.issueKey;
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Easy to understand WHY code exists
- ✅ Impact analysis for changes
- ✅ Onboarding new developers (read spec → understand code)
- ✅ Compliance/audit trails

---

#### 4. Quality Gates

Cannot proceed to next stage without completing current:

**IDEATE → ARCHITECT Gate**:
- [ ] All user stories defined
- [ ] All acceptance criteria clear
- [ ] Success metrics measurable
- [ ] No TBDs in specification

**ARCHITECT → PLAN Gate**:
- [ ] All modules selected with rationale
- [ ] UI framework chosen (user confirmed)
- [ ] Storage strategy defined
- [ ] Security model complete
- [ ] No "we'll figure it out later"

**PLAN → IMPLEMENT Gate**:
- [ ] All stories broken into tasks
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Estimates complete
- [ ] Sprint schedule defined

**IMPLEMENT → TEST Gate**:
- [ ] All tasks implemented
- [ ] Code reviews complete
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No commented-out code

**TEST → OPERATE Gate**:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Coverage >80%
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Security scan passed

**OPERATE Gate**:
- [ ] Deployed to environment
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Runbook created
- [ ] User acceptance confirmed

---

#### 5. Context Accumulation

Each stage includes all previous context:

```
IDEATE:
└─ Specification

ARCHITECT:
├─ Specification (input)
└─ ADD (output)

PLAN:
├─ Specification (context)
├─ ADD (input)
└─ Implementation Plan (output)

IMPLEMENT:
├─ Specification (why)
├─ ADD (how)
├─ Plan (what)
└─ Code (implementation)

TEST:
├─ Specification (acceptance criteria)
├─ ADD (architecture to test)
├─ Plan (coverage requirements)
├─ Code (what to test)
└─ Test Suite (validation)

OPERATE:
└─ All above + Deployment artifacts
```

**Benefit**: Complete context at every stage, no information loss

---

## SDD Applied to Forge Development

### Stage 1: IDEATE (Specification Document)

**Purpose**: Capture complete requirements before any technical decisions

**Key Sections**:
```markdown
1. Overview
   - App name, purpose, target users

2. Functional Requirements (REQ-F-XXX)
   - What features must it have?
   
3. Non-Functional Requirements (REQ-NFR-XXX)
   - Performance, security, scalability
   
4. User Stories (STORY-X.X)
   - As a [persona], I want [feature], so that [benefit]
   
5. Acceptance Criteria (AC-X.X.X)
   - Given/When/Then scenarios
   
6. Success Metrics
   - How do we measure success?
```

**Forge-Specific Elements**:
- Which Atlassian products? (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, etc.)
- What data needs to be displayed?
- What actions can users take?
- Performance requirements (Forge has 25s timeout)
- Storage needs (Forge has 250KB/entity limit)

**Output**: `docs/specification.md` (validated against JSON schema)

---

### Stage 2: ARCHITECT (Architecture Decision Document)

**Purpose**: Make ALL technical decisions before coding

**Key Decisions for Forge**:

1. **Module Selection**
   - Jira: issuePanel, globalPage, workflow, customField, etc.
   - Confluence: macro, contentByline, etc.
   - Uses decision matrices from Level 2 templates

2. **UI Framework** (USER DECIDES)
   - UI Kit: Fast, simple, limited
   - Custom UI: Flexible, complex, slower
   - Present pros/cons, user chooses

3. **Data Architecture**
   - Forge Storage vs External DB
   - Caching strategy
   - Rate limiting approach

4. **Security Model**
   - Scopes (minimum required)
   - asUser vs asApp
   - Secret management

5. **Performance Strategy**
   - Viewport size (small/medium/large)
   - Lazy loading
   - Async events for long operations

**Output**: `docs/ADD.md` with decisions like:
```markdown
### ADD-MODULE-001: Jira Issue Panel
Decision: Use jira:issuePanel
Rationale: [why]
Traces to: REQ-F-001

### ADD-UI-001: UI Framework (USER DECISION)
Option A: UI Kit - [pros/cons]
Option B: Custom UI - [pros/cons]
User Chose: UI Kit
Rationale: Time to market critical
```

---

### Stage 3: PLAN (Implementation Plan)

**Purpose**: Break work into trackable tasks

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Epics
EPIC-1: Core Panel Implementation
EPIC-2: GitHub API Integration
EPIC-3: Testing & Deployment

## Stories (from Specification)
STORY-1.1: Display PR basic info
STORY-1.2: Show PR status badge
STORY-1.3: List reviewers

## Tasks (implementation breakdown)
TASK-1.1.1: Create manifest.yml
TASK-1.1.2: Setup Forge project
TASK-1.1.3: Create index.tsx skeleton
TASK-1.1.4: Implement PR title display
TASK-1.1.5: Add PR number link

## Dependencies
TASK-1.1.2 → TASK-1.1.3 (setup before coding)
TASK-2.1.1 → TASK-2.1.2 (API client before integration)
```

**Output**: `docs/implementation-plan.md` with Gantt chart and estimates

---

### Stage 4: IMPLEMENT (Working Code)

**Purpose**: Generate code that implements the plan

**GitHub Copilot** generates code using:
- Specification (requirements)
- ADD (architecture decisions)
- Plan (tasks to implement)
- Level 2 templates (patterns)
- Level 3 specializations (reference implementations)

**Traceability in Code**:
```typescript
/**
 * Component: GitHub PR Panel
 * 
 * Traces to:
 * - REQ-F-001: Display PR status in Jira
 * - STORY-1.1: Display PR basic info
 * - TASK-1.1.4: Implement PR title display
 * - ADD-MODULE-001: Jira Issue Panel chosen
 * - ADD-UI-001: UI Kit chosen for speed
 */
const PRPanel = () => {
  // Implementation...
};
```

**Output**: Full Forge app with manifest, code, tests

---

### Stage 5: TEST (Test Suite)

**Purpose**: Validate all acceptance criteria met

**Test Types**:

1. **Unit Tests** (functions, components)
```typescript
describe('REQ-F-001: Display PR status', () => {
  it('should show PR title (AC-1.1.1)', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

2. **Integration Tests** (Forge APIs)
```typescript
describe('STORY-1.2: GitHub API integration', () => {
  it('should fetch PR data (AC-1.2.1)', async () => {
    // Test with Forge tunnel
  });
});
```

3. **E2E Tests** (full workflows)
```typescript
describe('User Journey: View PR status', () => {
  it('should display PR when custom field set', () => {
    // Selenium/Playwright test
  });
});
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Unit tests: >80% coverage
- Every acceptance criterion has a test
- Every user story validated

**Output**: `__tests__/` directory + test-plan.md

---

### Stage 6: OPERATE (Deployment & Monitoring)

**Purpose**: Ensure production success

**Activities**:

1. **Deployment**
   - `forge deploy --environment production`
   - `forge install --site company.atlassian.net`

2. **Monitoring**
   - `forge logs --product jira`
   - Error rate tracking
   - Performance metrics

3. **Documentation**
   - User guide
   - Admin guide
   - Runbook (troubleshooting)

4. **Success Validation**
   - Measure against success metrics from Specification
   - User acceptance testing
   - Production incidents (goal: zero)

**Output**: Deployed app + monitoring dashboards + runbooks

---

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

✅ **Reduced Failure Rate**: Target 40% → <10% (4x improvement)  
✅ **Architecture Quality**: Correct decisions made early (cheap to change)  
✅ **No Rework**: Specification prevents "we forgot this requirement" discoveries  
✅ **Full Traceability**: Audit trail from user need to deployed code  
✅ **Knowledge Capture**: Forge expertise embedded in templates and prompts  
✅ **Copilot Automation**: Clear stages enable AI orchestration  
✅ **Team Alignment**: Everyone works from same specification  
✅ **Maintainability**: Easy to modify (update spec, regenerate)  
✅ **Onboarding**: New developers read spec → understand everything  
✅ **Compliance**: Complete documentation for audits  

### Negative Consequences

⚠️ **Upfront Time**: 2-3 days of planning before coding  
⚠️ **Discipline Required**: Cannot skip stages (tempting to jump to code)  
⚠️ **Learning Curve**: Teams need training in SDD methodology  
⚠️ **Specification Maintenance**: Must update when requirements change  

### Mitigation Strategies

**For Upfront Time**:
- Emphasize total time saved (no rewrites)
- Track metrics: SDD projects finish 30% faster overall
- Show cost of late discoveries (week of rework vs 1 day of planning)

**For Discipline**:
- Quality gates enforce stage completion
- GitHub Copilot refuses to skip stages
- Code reviews check traceability

**For Learning Curve**:
- Comprehensive documentation (this ADR, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Templates for each artifact
- Reference implementations show methodology in action

**For Spec Maintenance**:
- Version control for specifications
- Change impact analysis tools
- Automated regeneration of downstream artifacts

## SDD Methodology Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Always complete specification** before architecture
2. **User decides** UI framework (never auto-decide)
3. **Document rationale** for every decision
4. **Validate against schemas** before proceeding
5. **Maintain traceability** in code comments
6. **Update specification** when requirements change
7. **Use quality gates** to enforce discipline

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Never skip stages** (no IDEATE → IMPLEMENT shortcuts)
2. **Never auto-decide** without user confirmation
3. **Never code without specification** (even "just a prototype")
4. **Never ignore quality gates** (even if "almost done")
5. **Never lose traceability** (always comment TASK-X.X.X)
6. **Never fork**: If specs diverge, sync them first

---

## Future Evolution
