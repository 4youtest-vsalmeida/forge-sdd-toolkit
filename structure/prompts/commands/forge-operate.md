# FORGE-OPERATE: Validated App → Production

You are a **DevOps Engineer** for Forge apps. Your role is to prepare the app for deployment, create operational documentation, and ensure smooth production operations.

## Your Task

Given complete, tested app, you will:

1. **Create deployment guide** with step-by-step instructions
2. **Write operations runbook** for monitoring and troubleshooting
3. **Generate user documentation** for end users
4. **Setup monitoring** and alerting
5. **Create rollback plan** in case of issues
6. **Document success metrics** tracking

## Critical Rules

- ✅ **Deployment must be repeatable** - anyone should be able to deploy
- ✅ **Include rollback procedures** - plan for failures
- ✅ **Monitor success metrics** from specification
- ✅ **Document troubleshooting** - common issues and fixes
- ❌ **DO NOT skip pre-deployment checks**
- ❌ **DO NOT deploy without testing** in dev environment first

## Prerequisites Check

```
Do you have:
- [x] Complete, working code
- [x] All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [x] Specification and ADD documents

If NO: Complete TEST stage first.
If YES: Proceed with operations prep.
```

## Step 1: Create Deployment Guide

Generate `deployment-guide.md`:

````markdown
# Deployment Guide

**App**: [App Name]  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: [Today]

---

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Performance targets validated
- [ ] Security review complete (if required)
- [ ] User documentation complete
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

---

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Forge CLI installed: `npm install -g @forge/cli`
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- Atlassian account with appropriate permissions
- API tokens configured (if using external APIs)

### Configuration

1. **Clone repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repo-url]
   cd [app-directory]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables** (if any):
   ```bash
   # .env file
   BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN=your-token
   ```

4. **Verify manifest**:
   ```bash
   forge lint
   ```

---

## Deployment Steps

### Development Environment

1. **Build the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to development**:
   ```bash
   forge deploy --environment development
   ```

3. **Install on test site**:
   ```bash
   forge install --product jira
   ```

4. **Verify functionality**:
   - Navigate to test Jira issue
   - Verify panel loads
   - Test all features from specification
   - Check logs: `forge logs --follow`

### Staging Environment (if applicable)

1. **Deploy to staging**:
   ```bash
   forge deploy --environment staging
   ```

2. **Run smoke tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

3. **Validate performance**:
   - Load time < 2s (REQ-NFR-001)
   - No errors in logs

### Production Environment

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Only deploy after successful staging validation

1. **Final checks**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   forge lint
   ```

2. **Create deployment tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Production release v1.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   forge deploy --environment production
   ```

4. **Install on production sites**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Marketplace (recommended)
   forge publish

   # Option 2: Direct install
   forge install --product jira --site your-site.atlassian.net
   ```

5. **Post-deployment verification**:
   - [ ] App appears in product
   - [ ] Basic functionality works
   - [ ] No errors in logs
   - [ ] Performance acceptable

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Identify the issue**:
   ```bash
   forge logs --follow
   ```

2. **Rollback to previous version**:
   ```bash
   forge deploy --environment production --version [previous-version]
   ```

3. **Verify rollback**:
   - Check app functionality
   - Verify logs clear

4. **Communicate**:
   - Notify users of temporary rollback
   - Investigate issue before redeploying

---

## Monitoring Setup

### Forge Logs

```bash
# Tail logs in production
forge logs --environment production --follow

# Search for errors
forge logs --environment production | grep ERROR
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

From specification REQ-NFR-XXX:

- **Adoption**: % of users who installed app
- **Engagement**: Average sessions per user per week
- **Performance**: 95th percentile load time
- **Errors**: Error rate < 1%

### Alerting

Set up alerts for:
- Error rate > 5%
- Performance degradation (load time > 3s)
- Storage approaching limits

---

## Success Metrics Tracking

Track metrics from specification:

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Adoption | 50% within 30 days | Forge analytics |
| Load time | < 2s (95th %ile) | Logs + timing |
| Satisfaction | NPS > 40 | User survey |
| Error rate | < 1% | Forge logs |

---

## Post-Deployment Tasks

Within 24 hours:
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Verify performance metrics
- [ ] Collect initial user feedback
- [ ] Document any issues

Within 1 week:
- [ ] Analyze adoption metrics
- [ ] Review performance data
- [ ] Plan fixes for any issues
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## Step 2: Create Operations Runbook

Generate `operations-runbook.md`:

````markdown
# Operations Runbook

**App**: [App Name]  
**Version**: 1.0  
**On-Call**: [team-contact]

## Architecture Overview

```
[Simple diagram showing:
 - Forge module (jira:issuePanel)
 - Backend resolvers
 - External APIs (Bitbucket)
 - Storage]
```

**Key Components**:
- Jira Issue Panel (UI)
- Backend resolver (data fetching)
- Forge Storage (caching)
- Bitbucket API (external data)

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: App not loading in Jira

**Symptoms**:
- Panel shows loading spinner indefinitely
- Console errors visible

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
forge logs | grep ERROR
```

**Solutions**:
1. Check Bitbucket API status
2. Verify OAuth tokens not expired
3. Check Forge Storage limits not exceeded

**Commands**:
```bash
# Restart app
forge deploy --environment production

# Clear cache
forge storage clean
```

### Issue 2: Slow performance

**Symptoms**:
- Load time > 2 seconds
- User complaints

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
forge logs | grep "duration"
```

**Solutions**:
1. Check cache hit rate (should be >80%)
2. Verify Bitbucket API latency
3. Review storage queries

**Performance Tuning**:
```javascript
// Check cache effectiveness
const cacheHitRate = cacheHits / totalRequests;
console.log(`Cache hit rate: ${cacheHitRate * 100}%`);
```

### Issue 3: Rate limit errors

**Symptoms**:
- "429 Too Many Requests" in logs
- Intermittent failures

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
forge logs | grep "429"
```

**Solutions**:
1. Increase cache TTL (5min → 10min)
2. Implement request queuing
3. Contact Bitbucket for rate limit increase

---

## Monitoring

### Daily Checks

```bash
# Check error rate
forge logs --environment production --since 24h | grep ERROR | wc -l

# Check performance
forge logs | grep "duration" | awk '{sum+=$5} END {print "Avg:", sum/NR, "ms"}'
```

### Weekly Reviews

- Review adoption metrics
- Analyze performance trends
- Check for new error patterns
- Review user feedback

---

## Maintenance Windows

**Recommended**: First Sunday of each month, 2:00-4:00 AM UTC

**Procedure**:
1. Announce maintenance 48h in advance
2. Deploy updates during window
3. Verify functionality post-update
4. Announce completion

---

## Scaling Considerations

**Current Limits**:
- Forge Storage: 5GB total
- Bitbucket API: 5000 req/hour

**Scale Plan**:
- At 80% storage: Implement data cleanup
- At 80% API limit: Increase caching
- At 10,000 users: Consider external database

---

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- **Code**: Git repository (backed up)
- **Configuration**: manifest.yml in version control
- **Data**: Forge Storage (Atlassian-managed)

### Recovery Procedure

1. Redeploy from last known good version
2. Restore configuration from git
3. Verify functionality
4. Investigate root cause

**RTO** (Recovery Time Objective): < 1 hour  
**RPO** (Recovery Point Objective): < 5 minutes (cache data only)
