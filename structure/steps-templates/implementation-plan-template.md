## 5. Effort Estimation

### Summary by Epic

| Epic | Stories | Tasks | Hours | % of Total |
|------|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| Epic 1: Foundation | 3 | 8 | 20h | 25% |
| Epic 2: Core Features | 4 | 12 | 40h | 50% |
| Epic 3: Secondary Features | 2 | 5 | 10h | 12% |
| Epic 4: Quality & Polish | 3 | 5 | 10h | 13% |
| **Total** | **12** | **30** | **80h** | **100%** |

### Estimation Methodology

**Task Sizing Guidelines**:
- Small task: 2 hours (simple function, configuration)
- Medium task: 4 hours (API integration, component)
- Large task: 8 hours (complex feature, multiple dependencies)

**Confidence Levels**:
- 🟢 High confidence: Foundation tasks (done this before)
- 🟡 Medium confidence: Core features (some unknowns)
- 🔴 Low confidence: None (architecture is clear)

### Buffer

**Contingency**: 20% (16 hours)
- Unforeseen issues: 10 hours
- Integration bugs: 4 hours
- Rework: 2 hours

**Total with Buffer**: 96 hours (~12 days for 1 developer)

## 6. Risk Management

### Risk 1: [Risk from ADD or new risk]
**Likelihood**: High | Medium | Low  
**Impact**: High | Medium | Low

**Mitigation**:

- Action 2: [Contingency plan]

**Tasks Affected**: [List of task IDs]

---

### Risk 2: External API Rate Limiting
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Implement aggressive caching first (TASK-2.2.1)
- Test with realistic load early (TASK-4.1.2)
- Have fallback to stale cache (TASK-3.1.1)

**Tasks Affected**: TASK-2.1.1, TASK-2.2.1

 */
async function fetchPRData(issueKey: string): Promise<PullRequest[]> {
  // Implementation
}
```
